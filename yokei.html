    <p>From the inspiring to the hilarious, the best Avengers quotes in the MCU prove why Earth's Mightiest Heroes have remained so memorable.</p>
</center>
<hr>
<p>2012's The Avengers marked the first time that all of Marvel Studios' superheroes had come together, but their first interaction was far from friendly. After Iron Man and Captain America had taken Loki captive, Thor took it upon himself to bring justice to his brother, forcing Iron Man and Captain America to intervene. This skirmish began with one of Tony Stark's most memorable lines, as he mocked Thor's clothing by relating his fashion sense to something resembling "Shakespeare in the park." Although the trio would later become firm allies, this little moment of jest - and a showing-off of powers - was a great way to introduce the future Avengers.</p>

<p>Marvel Studios really leaned into Thor's comedic side during 2017's Thor: Ragnarok, revitalizing the character with a more humorous edge, but that doesn't mean he didn't have some funny lines prior to Taika Waititi's MCU debut. Avengers: Age of Ultron saw the Avengers take on Ultron and his army of drones in Sokovia, and while he thought the battle was in their favor, Thor goaded Ultron by exclaiming, "is that the best you can do?" Ultron proceeded to show just how massive his army was, which, while intimidating the Avengers for a moment, were no match for the superheroes' combined might.</p>

<p>Avengers: Infinity War was a very emotional journey for every hero, but perhaps Vision and Wanda Maximoff had the most tragic storyline - at least until Thanos snapped his fingers. Realizing the only way to stop Thanos from getting all six Infinity Stones was to destroy the Mind Stone in his forehead, Vision begged Wanda to do the deed, ending his life but thwarting Thanos. This line called back to a tender moment the pair shared in a hotel room earlier on, before their lives were uprooted. </center>
